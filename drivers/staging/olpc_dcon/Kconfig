	  In order to support very low power operation, the XO laptop uses a
	  secondary Display CONtroller, or DCON.  This secondary controller
	  is present in the video pipeline between the primary display
	  controller (integrate into the processor or chipset) and the LCD
	  panel.  It allows the main processor/display controller to be
	  completely powered off while still retaining an image on the display.
	  This controller is only available on OLPC platforms.  Unless you have
	  one of these platforms, you will want to say 'N'.
